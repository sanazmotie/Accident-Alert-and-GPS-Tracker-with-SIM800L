1. Problem Identification
Key challenges in fleet management include:

Monitoring driver behavior for safe driving practices.
Real-time vehicle location tracking.
Environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity) to protect goods.
Immediate alerts in emergencies, such as accidents.
2. Solution Development
Hardware Components
ESP32 Microcontroller: Central processing unit for sensor data collection and communication.
SIM800L GSM/GPRS Module: Enables data transmission to a remote server and SMS communication.
MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope: Monitors vehicle acceleration and orientation.
Additional Sensors: For future enhancements like temperature and humidity monitoring.
Software Components
Embedded C/C++ Code: Handles data acquisition, processing, and communication.
AT Commands: Control the SIM800L module for SMS and GPRS communication.
ThingsBoard Platform: Visualizes data, triggers alerts, and provides analysis tools.
3. System Integration
ESP32 collects and processes data from the MPU6050 sensor.
SIM800L transmits data to the ThingsBoard platform via GPRS and handles SMS alerts.
The system sends real-time data and alerts to the ThingsBoard platform for monitoring and analysis.
4. Data Transmission and Monitoring
Data is sent to ThingsBoard using GPRS, where it is visualized in real-time.
The platform triggers alerts based on predefined conditions and logs data for further analysis.
5. Future Features and Enhancements
Potential enhancements include:

Environmental Monitoring: Adding temperature and humidity sensors.
Geofencing: Alerts when vehicles leave predefined areas.
Driver Behavior Analysis: Expanded monitoring and AI integration for fatigue detection.
6. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates how ESP32, SIM800L, MPU6050, and ThingsBoard can be integrated to create a powerful IoT solution for fleet management, improving safety and operational efficiency.
